## How it Works

<img src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1264b22-d0ad-44e8-9342-ec53ec94d37b"><br>

At the core of the system is a remote **Render** instance, which is scheduled to run every 24 hours at 7:00 AM UTC _(or 1:00 AM CST)_. This instance is responsible for scraping the dining menus from UT Austin, sourced from [this page](https://hf-foodpro.austin.utexas.edu/foodpro/location.aspx). Once the menus are scraped, the data is stored in a **Supabase** database.

Every 24 hours, the **Expo** mobile application fetches the latest menu data from the database, keeping the application up-to-date. To optimize performance and reduce loading times, the data is cached locally in an **SQLite** database using **Drizzle ORM**. This local cache allows the app to quickly retrieve the necessary information, ensuring a smooth, **offline-first** user experience.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)
- [Expo CLI](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/)
- An iOS or Android emulator. Follow the guide [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/) to set up an Android emulator or [here](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/) for an iOS simulator.

### VSCode Extensions

We recommend using the following VSCode extensions to improve your development experience:

- **[ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint)**: For identifying and fixing linting issues.
- **[Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)**: For automatic code formatting.
- **[Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss)**: For Tailwind CSS class autocomplete and IntelliSense.

### Installation

1. **Fork the Repository**

   Go to the [UT Dining repository](https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Dining.git) and click the [Fork](https://github.com/Longhorn-Developers/UT-Dining.git) button in the top-right corner of the page.

   After forking, clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ut-dining.git
   cd ut-dining
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```sh
    pnpm install

   ```

3. **Run Local Supabase Instance (OPTIONAL)**

   For this step, you need [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/) installed on your machine. Follow the guide to install it on your system.

   Next, install the Supabase CLI. Follow the guide [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started?queryGroups=platform&platform=macos#installing-the-supabase-cli).

   After installing the Supabase CLI, run the following command to start a local Supabase instance:

   ```sh
   supabase start
   ```

   Once it's up and running, you should see a message like this in the terminal:

   ```sh
   Started supabase local development setup.

         API URL: http://localhost:54321
          DB URL: postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:54322/postgres
      Studio URL: http://localhost:54323
    Inbucket URL: http://localhost:54324
        anon key: eyJh......
   service_role key: eyJh......
   ```

   The `API URL` and `anon key` are the environment variables you need to configure in the next step.

4. **Configure Environment Variables**

   Copy the `.env-example` file to create a `.env` file:

   ```sh
   cp .env-example .env
   ```

   Update with your Supabase `API URL` and `anon key` credentials:

   ```sh
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=<supabase-url>
    EXPO_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<supabase-anon-key>
   ```

   > If not running Supabase locally, ask [@EthanL06](https://github.com/EthanL06) for environment variables.

5. **Create an Expo Account**

   Create an account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev). Once you create the account, you can log in with:

   ```sh
   npx expo login
   ```

6. **Setup the Development Build**

   Since the app uses [react-native-mmkv](https://github.com/mrousavy/react-native-mmkv?tab=readme-ov-file) instead of `AsyncStorage`, you must run it with a development build rather than Expo Go.

   Run the following commands to build the development version:

   - **For iOS:**

     ```sh
     pnpm run ios
     ```

   - **For Android:**

     ```sh
     pnpm run android
     ```

   If you’re developing for both platforms, run both commands.

   > **Note**: The build process may take some time. Please wait until it completes.

7. **Download to physical device (OPTIONAL)**

   If you want to test the app on a physical device, connect your device to your computer
   with a USB cable and run the following command:

   - **For iOS:**

   ```sh
   npx expo run:ios --device
   ```

   - **For Android:**

   ```sh
   npx expo run:android --device
   ```

   > **Note**: Make sure to enable USB debugging on your Android device. You can find the instructions [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/debug/dev-options).

   This will install the development build onto your device.

8. **Start the Development Server**

   ```sh
   pnpm run start
   ```

   Make sure that you are using `development build` instead of `Expo Go` when running the app. You can switch to the development build by pressing `s` in the terminal.

   **Tunneling for Physical Devices**

   If you're using a physical device on a public Wi-Fi network, use the following commands to tunnel the server to your device:

   ```sh
   pnpm run start --tunnel
   ```

   > Note: Tunneling may have limitations with Supabase connections. Using an emulator is recommended for full functionality.

   **Debugging Drizzle with Drizzle Studio**

   While the development server is running, press `Shift + M` in the terminal and select `expo-drizzle-studio-plugin` to open Drizzle Studio in your browser. You can use this tool to inspect the SQLite database and troubleshoot any issues related to the local cache with SQLite and Drizzle ORM. Read more about Drizzle Studio [here](https://orm.drizzle.team/drizzle-studio/overview).

9. **Launch Emulators**

   To open the app on an emulator, press either of the following keys in the terminal:

   - `a` to open on Android emulator
   - `i` to open on iOS simulator
